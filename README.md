# **Moose**

A simple clone of mongoose, used for some WeThinkCode_ projects, made by [MikeFMeyer](https://github.com/mikefmeyer) & [FWMoor](https://github.com/FWMoor).

### **Description**

We can't use mongoose for some of our projects, so we decided to create our own. This is a much simpler version of mongoose, but it does what we need it to do.

## **Objective**

Recreating and adding some features and functions to use in our WeThinkCode_ projects.

## **Functions**  

### **General Functions**  

- **connect** (database name, callback function):  
  > This makes a connection to the database.  

- **getPrimaryKey** (id):  

### **Insert Function**

- **insert** (collection, data, callback function):

### **Find Functions**

- **findAll** (collection, callback function):  
- **findById** (collection, id, callback function):  
- **findOneById** (collection, id, callback function):  
- **findByAny** (collection, options, callback function):  
- **findOneByAny** (collection, options, callback function):

### **Update Functions**

- **updateById** (collection, id, data, callback function):  
- **updateManyById** (collection, id, data, callback function):

### **Delete Functions**

- **deleteAll** (collection, options, callback function):  
- **deleteOne** (collection, id, callback function):

## Usage



## Disclaimer  

Moose does not contain all the features and functions mongoose has. Please read through the documentation for Moose before using it.
