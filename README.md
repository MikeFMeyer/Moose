# **Moose**

A simple clone of mongoose, used for some WeThinkCode_ projects, made by [MikeFMeyer](https://github.com/mikefmeyer) & [FWMoor](https://github.com/FWMoor).

### **Description**

We can't use mongoose for some of our projects, so we decided to create our own. This is a much simpler version of mongoose, but it does what we need it to do.
