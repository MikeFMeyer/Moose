# **Moose**

A simple clone of mongoose, used for some WeThinkCode_ projects, made by [MikeFMeyer](https://github.com/mikefmeyer) & [FWMoor](https://github.com/FWMoor).

### **Description**

We can't use mongoose for some of our projects, so we decided to create our own. This is a much simpler version of mongoose, but it does what we need it to do.

## **Objective**

Recreating and adding some features and functions to use in our WeThinkCode_ projects.

## **Features**

### **Insert Function**

- ***insert(collection, data, cb)***:

### **Find Functions**

- ***insert(collection, data, cb)***:

### **Update Functions**

- ***insert(collection, data, cb)***:

### **Delete Functions**

- ***insert(collection, data, cb)***:

## Usage



## Disclaimer  

Moose does not contain all the features and functions mongoose has. Please read through the documentation for Moose before using it.
