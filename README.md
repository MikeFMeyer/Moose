## **Usage**

## **Validation**  
Add the following to the schema to validate the input:  

- **required**   
  If required is set to true, input is expected. If not input is received, an error will be added to the object. 
  > Expects a boolean value.  
  
- **min**  
  Min sets the minimum value of the input received. If the input is less, an error will be added to the object.  
  > Expects a numeric value.  
  
- **max**   
  Max sets the maximum value of the input received. If the input is more, an error will be added to the object.  
  > Expects a numeric value.  
  
- **length**  
  Length sets the minimum length of the input. If the input's length is less, an error will be added to the object.  
  > Expects a numeric value.  
  
- **max-length**    
  Max-length sets the maximum length of the input. If the input's is more, an error will be added to the object.  
  > Expects a numeric value.  
  
- **strong**    
  If strong is set to true, the input is checked to see if it contains at least 1 lowercase character, 1 uppercase character, 1 numeric value and 1 special character. If it doesn't, an error will be added to the object.  
  > Expects a boolean value.  
  
- **email**   
  If email is set to true, the input is checked to see if it is a valid email address (only the formating of the address is checked). If not, and error is added to the object.  
  > Expects a boolean value.  
  
- **matches**    
  Matches compares the input to the given key's input. If they're not the same or the given key doesn't exist, an error is added to the object.  
  > Expects a key name.  
  
- **hash**   
  If hash is set to true, the input is hashed using [bcrypt](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcrypt).  
  > Expects a boolean value.  
  
- **default**  
  This allows you to set a default value for a field. If no input value is given the default value will be used.
  > Expects any value.
  
- **enum**  
  Checks if input fits into a given enum. If not, an error is added to the object.  
  > Expects an array of possible values.
